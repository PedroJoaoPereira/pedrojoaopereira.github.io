Each of the entities were implemented as an intelligent agent with their own set of rules, goals and behaviours. These entities interacted autonomously with each other in order to reduce their own respective travelling costs. A dispatch central agent (red square in the figure) was created to coordinate the taxi services with the passengers requests. In this simulation, the passengers (blue circles in the figure) spawn in some random location of the map and instantly send a taxi service request to the dispatch central. The latter calculates the cheapest travelling cost for both taxis and passengers. The taxi (yellow circles in the figure) reduces its travelling costs by servicing multiple passengers at the same time from the queue of requests, but only if the new service does not imply a worse travelling itinerary for the currrent passenger.",
