          <p></p>
          <p>You can call me Pedro and I am a computer scientist. I am passionate about technology and from a young age I always wanted to pursue a career that allowed me to fully understand computers. So, here I am now with a Master's degree and a whole lot
            of eagerness to be part of new projects! Since I love to
            <span class="text-primary">solve complex problems the most efficient way</span>, my favorite areas to work in the field of computer science are
            <span class="text-primary">parallel computing</span>
            and
            <span class="text-primary">machine learning</span>. This website was created to show you my academic and professional achievements, as well as what I am looking for to accomplish in my future, which is to
            <span class="text-primary">be part of the development team of a start up company</span>
            that develops projects in my favorite working areas.</p>

              <p>Since I started working at MOG Technologies I have been part of different projects from low level software development, to web development and data science.</p>
              <p>The first project I was involved with was a low level software development project which allowed me to work with parallel computing and its goal was to implement performance optimizations techniques to multiple video manipulation operations.</p>
              <p>I was also responsible for the development of a front-end application that linked to a service created by a team of developers to allow them to easily test their work and to have a fully operational demonstrational project.</p>
              <p>Most recently I am being integrated in a new team, the data science team, and for that reason I am still getting to know the projects but these projets will allow me to work with data mining and software optimization.</p>

                patterns to the final users in order to ease off their work.</p>
              <p>The sensors data is fetched and processed by multiple docker containers that make up individual modules of the system. After the information being processed, it is provided through an API to a front-end application that displays it in a simpler

              <p>The goal of this project was to create a real world simulation of taxis, passengers and a dispatch central. Each of the entities were implemented as an intelligent agent with their own set of rules, goals and behaviours. These entities interacted
                autonomously with each other in order to reduce its own travelling costs. A dispatch central agent (red square in the figure) was created to coordinate the taxi services with the passengers' requests. In this simulation, the passengers (blue circles
                in the figure) spawn in some random location of the map and instantly send a taxi service request to the dispatch central. The latter calculates the cheapest travelling cost for both taxis and passengers. The taxi (yellow circles in the figure)
                reduce its travelling costs by servicing multiple passengers at the same time, from the queue of requests, but only if the new service does not imply a worse travelling itinerary for the currrent passenger.</p>
